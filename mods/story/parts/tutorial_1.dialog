You : Yes, I heard that this is a city where many adventurers live.
Kai : That is right.
Kai : You dont have some basic materials with you to build a house, have you?
You : no, not yet
Kai : Ok, I think you should get some stones - they lay on the floor.
Kai : I have some wood for you.
You : Thank you :D
Kai : Come back when you have some stones.
